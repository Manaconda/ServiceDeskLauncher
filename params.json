{"name":"Connect Up Support Launcher","tagline":"","body":"### Installation.\r\n\r\n[Download Latest Release (V1.2 Updated 24/09/2015)](https://github.com/Manaconda/ServiceDeskLauncher/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nIt’s an MSI and is designed to be pushed out via Group Policy but it will install normally as well and will prompt if it needs elevation. \r\n\r\n### How it works. \r\nThe Installer adds a shortcut to the All Users Start Menu, launching it at login.  It shows a splash screen for a second then puts this Icon:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ss0QTIy.png)\r\n \r\nIn the notification area.  Left or Right clicking it will being up this panel.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qFvQlO0.png)\r\n\r\nFrom top to bottom:\r\n\r\n•\tHostname and IP address of the machine – thought it may come in handy when customers call up with issues.\r\n\r\n•\tA clickable link to the website.\r\n\r\n•\tLog a ticket button – Takes you to service desk.  Until I can find a way of making service desk log in users will still have to enter their details (probably best security wise anyway)\r\n\r\n•\tTeamViewer Icon – Launches an instant support Teamviewer session – Useful if the machine doesn’t have Teamviewer installed, plus its bundled in with the app, don’t have to go to a website and download it.\r\n\r\n•\tClose – Closes the panel, not the program.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
